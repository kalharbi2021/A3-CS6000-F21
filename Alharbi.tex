\subsection{The First Section}

I have registered for this course as a prerequisite for a Ph.D. program. Through this course, I hope to learn how to write a research paper in a scientific way.  I hope to understand how to select relevant articles related to my area of research. So, I can improve my practice and knowledge of the latest updates and new topics of my work. I hope to know the correct ways to read research papers, compare between them, present a discussion of those papers. I would be interested to learn how to present my research work and how to write the paper scientifically. In addition, I hope I can recognize the different sections of scientific documents, such as the introduction, methodology,  results and discussion, and conclusion.  I want to learn how to present the contribution of my work easily and clearly. Expectedly, I will learn how to layout my experiment methodology, how to get the result, and how to analyze them. I hope to gain and be able to conduct a comprehensive survey on my field of interest and to write a good paper using scientific techniques, essential and effective statistical methods. Hopefully, I will be able to publish this paper in a good conference or journal.
